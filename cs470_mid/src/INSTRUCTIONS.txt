COMPILING THE CODE

In order to create the code for the serial tests type:
    $make cycle_test
This will create an executable called "cycle_test" that you can run.
The output for cycle_test is if the algorithm found the cycle (0=False 1=True)
and the time it took for the cycle to be detected.

In order to create the code for the parallel tests type:
    $make dist_cycle_test
This will create an executable called "dist_cycle_test" that you can run.
The output for cycle_test is if the algorithm found the cycle (0=False 1=True)
and the time it took for the cycle to be detected.

CHANGING THE TESTS

In order to change the variables used in the test code:
    -V: number of vertices
    -loop_root: node that the final node connects to creating a cycle
    -num_threads
you must go into the cycle_test.c or dist_cycle_test.c and uncomment out the
appropriate code.

Automated tests are coming, but have not yet been implemented.
